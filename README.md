# Python Core Topics Practice Problems: Solutions and Automation

This repository contains solutions to a set of practice problems covering fundamental Python concepts, intended to be used as a learning resource for beginners and as a reference for those looking to refresh their knowledge. The solutions are generated using a simple Python script to ensure consistency and automate the process.

## Overview

This repository provides comprehensive solutions to practice problems covering the following Python core topics:

* **Type Conversion:** Converting data between different types (e.g., string to integer, tuple to dictionary).
* **Print Operations:**  Controlling output formatting and using print statements effectively.
* **String Manipulation:** Modifying strings, removing duplicates, and using string formatting methods.
* **Loops:** Performing iterative operations, such as printing characters in a string or iterating through lists.
* **Lists:**  Manipulating lists, including adding elements, finding lengths, and removing duplicates.
* **Tuples:**  Performing tasks related to tuples, such as calculating sums, removing duplicates, and sorting.
* **Dictionaries:**  Working with dictionaries, including adding keys, accessing values, and merging dictionaries.
* **Sets:**  Manipulating sets, such as removing duplicates, finding differences, and converting to other data structures.

## Structure

The repository is organized with a folder for each topic, containing Python files for each problem solution:

* **Type Conversion:** `TYPE-QUE1.py`, `TYPE-QUE2.py`, etc.
* **Print Operations:** `PRINT-QUE1.py`, `PRINT-QUE2.py`, etc.
* **... and so on for other categories.**

## Usage

### Generating Solutions

1. **Requirements:** Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. **Run the script:** Execute the `generate_solutions.py` script from your terminal:
   ```bash
   python TYPE-QUE(Num).py
